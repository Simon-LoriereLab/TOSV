# Insights from the Toscana virus diversity captured in southern Spain 2015 - 2019

This repository analyzes genomes of Toscana virus (TOSV) circulating in southern Spain between 2015 and 2019 using [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/).
The build was constructed using the genomes generated in this study (n=7) with all available complete TOSV genomes (n=22). Complete taxa names and metadata can be found in Supplementary Table.

The phylogenies placed our TOSV genomes within genotype B and they can be visualized at https://nextstrain.org/community/Simon-LoriereLab/TOSV@main/M

Phylogenetic analysis of the three TOSV genome segments showed branching incongruences for one TOSV sequence suggesting an intra-genotype reassortment event for TOSV and the first evidence of reassortment in TOSV.
 
The phylogeny highlighting the incongruent placement of TOSV/Spain/LCR_515/2017 can be visualized at:

This work has been performed in collaboration with [Instituto San Carlos III](https://www.isciii.es/) and [Instituto Maimónides de Investigación Biomédica de Córdoba](https://www.imibic.org) (contact: Maria Dolores Fernandez Garcia mdfernandez@isciii.es). 

We would like to thank all the authors, originating and submitting laboratories of the sequences from GenBank (Acknowledgement_table). We gratefully acknowledge their contributions.

## Primers scheme

We provide here a short amplicon scheme developed to help sequence low concentration or partially degraded samples corresponding to TOSV genotype B circulating in countries of the Mediterranean basin in recent years.
The primers scheme was built using [Primal Scheme](https://primalscheme.com/) and we followed the [PrimalSeq](https://www.protocols.io/view/primalseq-generation-of-tiled-virus-amplicons-for-bez7jf9n) protocol for the generation of tiled virus amplicons.
